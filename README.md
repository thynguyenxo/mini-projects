# Hello there!
This repo is a compilation of projects I've completed for The Odin Project. This is a great learning resource for front-end development. I have learned so much about different aspects of front-end development by getting my hand dirty building these projects. More details can be found at: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

Examples of some of the work that I've done in the past:
* [Hello there!](#hello-there)
  * [Classic landing page](#classic-landing-page)
  * [Sign-up form](#sign-up-form)
  * [Admin dashboard](#admin-dashboard)
  * [Etch-a-sketch](#etch-a-sketch)
  * [Library App](#library-app)
  * [Tic Tac Toe](#tic-tac-toe)
  * [Restaurant page](#restaurant-page)
